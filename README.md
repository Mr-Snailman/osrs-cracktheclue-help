# OSRS Crack The Clue Helper Scripts

## word-match-catch.py

Requirements: Python 3

Thought process is going along with the Fish theory, but also with a hidden anagram once the fish 'word' is removed.

I took the full lines, each line individually (left/right), as well as the transposed versions of the text.

Feel free to add words to the dictionary and take a look at what is there.

Future work would include:

* Streamlining command-line usage
* Adhoc dictionary additions
* Additive removals from fish words found

## caesar.py

Simple Caesar/Shift Cipher helper utility.

Future work would include:

* Streamlining command-line usage
* Include other ciphers (FISH cipher AKA UK's Enigma-like cipher engine?)
